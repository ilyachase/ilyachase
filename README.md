# Hi, I'm Ilya üëã

> Software developer at heart. Building bridges between code and humanity. Transforming technological possibilities into realities that enrich communities.

## What drives me

I believe great software isn't just about clean code‚Äîit's about understanding the human problems behind technical challenges. Whether it's helping teams scale their architecture or making developers' lives easier with simple browser extensions, I'm passionate about creating solutions that matter.

## Where I've made impact

**@ US healthcare company (confidential)**  
Building an AI support agent from the ground up, creating intelligent systems that help people live healthier lives

**@ Lokalise**  
Solved critical scalability challenges that enabled rapid startup growth, mentored engineers and tackled complex Elasticsearch challenges at enterprise scale

**@ Realforce**  
Architected modern Symfony solutions for real estate classifieds

**@ 74.ru**  
Led 6 developers building a high-load news platform serving millions daily. Mastered the art of keeping 1.3M+ lines of legacy code both maintainable and performant.

## Passion projects

### üîÑ [Quick Tab Switch](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/quick-tab-switch/jceaicinopjaoknlhdfdjileacogogep)
A Chrome extension born from my own frustration‚ÄîAlt+Tab for browser tabs. Because switching between documentation and code shouldn't require a mouse.

### üåê [PAC Proxy Manager](https://github.com/ilyachase/pac-proxy-manager-extension)
Open-source proxy management made simple. Built with React and modern tooling, supporting 13+ languages because developer tools should be accessible to everyone.

### üìö [Decoupling Monoliths: A Practical Guide](https://medium.com/@ilyachase/practical-example-of-decoupling-a-monolithic-php-application-6ff82fefc80a)
Turned years of refactoring experience into a comprehensive technical article. Real code, real problems, real solutions‚Äîno fluff.
